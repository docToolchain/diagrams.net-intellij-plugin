=== Problem

For testing, we need a test-framework.

=== Decision

We start out with Spock as test-framework

=== Alternatives

==== JUnit-X vs. Spock

JUnit seems to be the standard test-framework for Java or Kotlin development.
However, Spock seems to be more powerful and lets us use the Behaviour-Driven-Development approach.

=== Consequences

With Spock, we add Groovy as additional language to the project.
This raises the complexity, and we have to see if this is worth it.
Should we notice that we need another test-framework, we can install it as additional one and still keep the Spock tests.
