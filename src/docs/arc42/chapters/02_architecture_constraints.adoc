* starting with IntelliJ 2020.2, the JavaFX based browser solution within IntelliJ will be deprecated and replaced with the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) in its Java based version (JCEF)footnote:[see the JetBraint Platform blog post from July 15, 2020: https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2020/07/javafx-and-jcef-in-the-intellij-platform/].
So, the architecture has to support JCEF.
* current IntelliJ ships with Java 11 as runtime.
So the system must run on Java 11 and higher.
