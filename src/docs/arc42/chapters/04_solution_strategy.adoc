== Solution Strategy

diagrams.net is a web based diagramming tool which runs in different browsers.
Since IntelliJ version 2020.01, JetBrains added the https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/reference_guide/jcef.html[JCEF - Java Chromium Embedded Framework] to its platform.

This enables us to use the powerful chromium browser to run diagrams.net within IntelliJ.

The diagrams.net documentation has good https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-integration[examples on how to embedd diagrams.not in a stand aline, local HTML page].
These where used as a starting point, together with the knowledge of Henning Dieterichs, the author of the draw.io plugin for VS Code.
He learned a lot about draw.io while writing his plugin and thus helped to get draw.io up and running as offline solution.

The Kotlin based IntelliJ Plugin and the web based draw.io communicate via event messages. See Chapter 06 for more details.
