If you like, you can help to evolve it.

## FAQ

### How do I build and run this project?

For development purpose, clone the project locally and start it with the command

`./gradlew runIde`

This will build the plugin and start an Instance of IntelliJ with the plugin already installed.
You can even start this in debug mode.
